.SH NAME
rtdset \- Task CPU affinity and Intel(R) Resource Director Technology control tool
.br
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rdtset
.RI "<-t feature=value;...cpu=cpulist>... -c <cpulist> (-p <pid> | [-k] cmd [<args>...])"
.br
.B rdtset
.RI "-r <cpulist> <-t feature=value;...cpu=cpulist>... -c <cpulist> (-p <pid> | [-k] cmd [<args>...])"
.br
.B rdtset
.RI "-r <cpulist> -c <cpulist> (-p <pid> | [-k] cmd [<args>...])"
.br
.B rdtset
.RI "-r <cpulist> <-t feature=value;...cpu=cpulist>... -p <pid>"
.SH DESCRIPTION
For more details on Intel(R) Resource Director Technology see
.br

.br
or https://github.com/01org/intel-cmt-cat/wiki
.PP
The rdtset tool provides support to set up the CAT (Cache Allocation Technology) capabilities
for a task and set its CPU affinity. Current RDT/CAT operations of the utility are based on controlling
MSR registers (via libpqos library). Class of service 0 (CLOS0) is assumed as default one.
In command mode, rdtset forks and one process executes the command. Another process waits
for the task to terminate and restores default CAT state by assigning cpu's back to CLOS0. This
behavior is not in place in PID mode.
.SH OPTIONS
rdtset options are as follow:
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show help
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
Verbose mode
.TP
.B \-t\ , \-\-rdt\ feature=value;...cpu=cpulist
Specify RDT configuration, single class configuration per -t, multiple -t options allowed.
.br
Accepted values for features:
.br
.B 2, l2   for level 2 cache
.br
.B 3, l3   for level 3 cache

For example:

.B \-t\ 'l3=0xf;cpu=1'
.br
CPU 1 uses four L3 cache-ways (mask 0xf)

.B \-t\ 'l3=0xf;cpu=2' -t 'l3=0xf0;cpu=3,4,5'
.br
CPU 2 uses four L3 cache-ways (mask 0xf), CPUs 3-5 share four L3 cache-ways
(mask 0xf0), L3 cache-ways used by CPU 2 and 3-4 are non-overlapping

.B \-t\ 'l3=0xf;cpu=0-2' -t 'l3=0xf0;cpu=3,4,5'
.br
CPUs 0-2 share four L3 cache-ways (mask 0xf), CPUs 3-5 share four L3 cache-ways
(mask 0xf0), L3 cache-ways used by CPUs 0-2 and 3-5 are non-overlapping

.B \-t\ 'l3=0xf,0xf0;cpu=1'
.br
On CDP enabled system, CPU 1 uses four cache-ways for code (mask 0xf)
and four cache-ways for data (mask 0xf0),
data and code cache-ways are non-overlapping
.TP
.B \-c <cpulist>, \-\-cpu <cpulist>
Specify CPU affinity configuration, a numerical list of processors. The numbers
are separated by commas and may include ranges. For example:
.BR 1-3,4,5 .
.TP
.B \-p <pid>, \-\-pid <pid>
Operate on existing, given pid
.TP
.B \-r <cpulist>, \-\-reset <cpulist>
Reset CAT for CPUs (assign COS#0 to listed CPUs)
.br
For example:

.B \-r 0-5
.br
Reset CAT configuration of CPUs 0-5

.B \-r 0-5 \-t\ 'l3=0xf0;cpu=0-5' \-c 0-5 \-p $BASHPID
.br
Reconfigure CAT for CPUs 0-5
.br
In order to reconfigure CAT, it is needed to reset current CAT configuration

.TP
.B \-k, \-\-sudokeep
Do not drop sudo elevated privileges
.SH NOTES
.PP
CAT is configured using Model Specific Registers (MSRs)
to set up the class of service masks and manage
the association of the cores/logical threads to a class of service.
The rdtset software executes in user space, and access to the MSRs is
obtained through a standard Linux*/FreeBSD* interface.
Under Linux, the virtual file system structure /dev/cpu/CPUNUM/msr provides
an interface to read and write the MSRs, under FreeBSD it is /dev/cpuctlCPUNUM.
The msr/cpuctl file interface is protected and requires root
privileges. The msr/cpuctl driver might not be auto-loaded and on some
modular kernels the driver may need to be loaded manually:
.PP
Under Linux:
.br
sudo modprobe msr
.PP
Under FreeBSD:
.br
sudo kldload cpuctl
