Installation Steps
==================

For installation of the software package untar the gzip image and follow
below instructions. As the results the following components will be built and
installed:
- PQoS DSO and its header file (libpqos.so and pqos.h)
- PQoS utility executable (pqos)
- PQoS man page (pqos.8)
- rdtset tool executable (rdtset)
- rdtset man page (rdtset.8)

NOTE to FreeBSD users, remember to replace "make" with "gmake" in
the steps described below.

The following steps are required to compile and install the package:
$ make
$ sudo make install

"make" compiles all software components of the package.
"sudo make install" installs compiled files into system directories.

By default, files are installed below /usr/local but it can be changed
with use of PREFIX to install files below /some/where:
$ sudo make install PREFIX=/some/where

Software package files can be removed but the same PREFIX has to be
used for uninstall and install targets.
To remove files from below default PREFIX:
$ sudo make uninstall
To remove from below /some/where:
$ sudo make uninstall PREFIX=/some/where

Software package files can be cleaned with "make clean" command.


Linux
=====

CMT, MBM and CAT are configured using Model Specific Registers (MSRs)
to measure occupancy, set up the class of service masks and manage
the association of the cores/logical threads to a class of service.
The pqos software executes in user space, and access to the MSRs is
obtained through a standard Linux* interface. The virtual file system
structure /dev/cpu/CPUNUM/msr provides an interface to read and write
the MSRs. The msr file interface is protected and requires root
privileges. The msr driver might not be auto-loaded and on some
modular kernels the driver may need to be loaded manually:

$ modprobe msr

For instructions on package installation please see "Installation Steps"
section.

In case of compilation error such as:
"pidapi.c:46:30: fatal error: linux/perf_event.h: No such file or directory compilation terminated."

Please compile the code without PID monitoring support:
$ make NO_PID_API=y
This occurs on Linux kernels that do not support perf monitoring events.


FreeBSD (experimental)
======================

CMT, MBM and CAT are configured using Model Specific Registers (MSRs)
to measure occupancy, set up the class of service masks and manage
the association of the cores/logical threads to a class of service.
The pqos software executes in user space, and access to the MSRs is
obtained through a standard FreeBSD* cpuctl driver interface. The virtual
file system structure /dev/cpuctlCPUNUM provides an interface to read
and write the MSR registers. The MSR file interface is protected and
requires root privileges.
The cpuctl driver might not be auto-loaded on some systems. Please follow
cpuctl (4) man page to load cpuctl driver on your system.

$ man 4 cpuctl

Please note that all project build scripts have been written for GNU Make so
it is required to install GNU Make on FreeBSD in order to compile the project.

$ pkg install gmake

For instructions on package installation please see "Installation Steps"
section. Remember to replace "make" with "gmake" on FreeBSD.

Currently verified configuration is:
- Intel(R) Xeon(R) processor D
- FreeBSD 9.1
- GNU Compiler Collection 5 (gcc 5.3.1)
- GNU Make 4.1
